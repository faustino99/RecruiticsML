# RecruiticsML

In this project, I created a couple of prototype machine learning models that primarily used existing online job ad data from the data analytics and marketing company Recruitics to predict the number of applications that a given job ad will recieve. My first step was extracting important data from millions of raw data events that Recruitics logs of its clients job ads. This involved making a complex SQL query (shown in **SQL_Query.txt**) which calculated the average cost per apply, the number of views, the age, the location, and the number of applications for each job ad. Using data tables created from this query, I wrote a few functions in **SparkMLTestModels.kt** that tested out a linear regression and a random forest desicion tree model. These functions include the capability (explained in more detail in the comments) to tune each model's unique hyperparameters and modify which data inputs are to be used. The functions also allow the user to compare different hyperparameters and input configurations with one another and determine which has the lowest error when tested using cross validation. **SparkMLTests.kt** is simply a driver file which calls the functions in **SparkMLTestModels**. 

Because Recruitic's data is private, I only uploaded my code to this repository and none of the datasets that I used. This project was primarily written in Kotlin, a languange in the JVM family.
